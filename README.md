Project developed during Next Level Week # 01. Ecoleta is a waste collection application, in which you can register and find collection points close to where you live or based on your location.
  
The development stack used was:

* __Back-end__: NodeJS
* __Front-end__: ReactJS
* __Mobile__: React Native

## Requirements
---

* [Node](https://nodejs.org/) (Currently using v12.16.1)
* [Node Package Manager](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Currently using v6.13.4)

We strongly recommend that you use [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to easily switch between NodeJS versions, alternatively, you can use docker.
